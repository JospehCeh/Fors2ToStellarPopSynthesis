Quick Start
===========


Run the SPP fits
----------------

After testing the fits with the notebooks in ``docs/notebooks/fitters``, then the full production of SSP fit over fors2 spectra
can be run from :

``src/fors2tostellarpopsynthesis/fit_all.py``.

However it happens the python process may be killed at some point during the loop. Then it has to be relaunch starting at the point of the crash.
(Edit the python file for the moment).



Use the fit results
-------------------


To use the DSPS fit results directly, please refer to the folder ``docs/notebooks/fitanalysis``.

By example see ``the notebook  in /docs/notebooks/fitanalysis/ViewFittedSSP``.
